# Retro 04/20/20

* Led by: Steven Seong
* Present: Steven Seong, Xilin Wang, Brian Kang , Ari Polakof
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* a goal: Our team could communicate and cooperate better with each other for issues that we collectively struggle with.
* a change: We could send an emote on the Slack channel to acknowledge that we've seen each other's posts, and we could respond to each other more often.
* a measurement: In the future, we could check to see if less time passes between when one of us posts on Slack and one of us responds, attempting to solve the issue. Furthermore, we could all post on our Slack channel whenever we finish an assignment or task that we are all doing, and if all 4 of us complete the task well before the deadline, then our communication orobably has improved.
## Retro Assessment
I attempted to use the Start/Stop/Continue method as a retro template, but kind of deviated from it over time.
This retro went mostly well, but required a lot of time and guidance to get on track, and also to get a feel for how a team retro was supposed to be like.
For the next retro leader, I would suggest ensuring that the retro discussion occurs sooner. I would also suggest that the retro leader prepare a few topics of discussion to deliberate ahead of time, rather than winging it when the retro has already started.

* Brief Assessment of how it went: It went alright. We figured out that we need to work on making progress on the project.
* Advice for retro: Prepare for the retro before hand so you aren't lost when leading. Also keep in mind the previous retro's action items so you know how much progress the team made and if the action item was even useful

## Retro Assessment
I followed the Darby/Larsen’s five stages of a successful retro. The retro went smooth but didn't come up with many useful ideas that we can use in future iterations at beginning as our team is satisfied with what we have now and believe that our team is on the right track. But after Phill's help we recognized that a good software development team should always strive for better. So we took our time and come up with some more ideas that can improve our performance. I ended the retro by asking everyone to appreciate each other and that went smooth as well.
For future retro leader, I suggest them don't be satisfied with team's current situation. Always come up with some questions to let team members reflect on themselves.
